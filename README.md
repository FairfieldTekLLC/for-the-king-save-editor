# For The King - save game editor
This tool allows you to edit your Lore points as well as the gold and stats of your characters in your games.

Current release [1.1.4](https://github.com/warsnek/for-the-king-save-editor/releases/tag/1.1.4)


Note: When you clone this project and try to build it from visual studio first run "Clean Solution" then Rebuild, without this it seems to have a problem with its SQLite nuget dependency.
